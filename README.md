Hudson Furnishing is a single page website which was created to make online shopping easy and stress-free. We would examine a few project-related elements for the project analysis. Additionally, we would lay out the purpose of the Hudson Furnishing website, which is to provide customers access to the items online and enable them to browse and place orders regardless of where they are. Additionally, it aims to facilitate ordering for those who prefer not to physically visit. 
This website was created using an ecommerce website design, which makes it easier for people to navigate. For convenience of reading, product descriptions and pricing are shown on the website alongside the goods
