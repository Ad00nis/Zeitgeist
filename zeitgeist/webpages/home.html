        I came to this company because I have struggled in my own art business  for over 8 years. I got stuck on the copy every single time.

        I wanted to learn how to persuade potential buyers to get in touch with me because making people completely sit down and appreciate art is extremely difficult. Zeitgeist course saved me. I loved the new styles that they teach you, step by step, how to organize your portfolio page and what to say in each section. Each section has an objective. Plus, the example layouts for different kinds of artists were invaluable.
        
        I sailed through their teachings in about 10 days because it’s sectioned into digestible modules that kept me curious to learn more. My painting skills have improved drastically and I’ve taken up a new interest in the world of photography. <b>Thank you, Zeitgeist!</b></p>

        <img class="numimage" src="../images/two.jpeg" alt="man"><p>I’ve done a couple of artworks in the past and I have loads of ideas. But I get overwhelmed and I’m not good at structuring. So I still felt stuck.

            After reading Zeitgeist blog for a few months, I purchased the Enchanting Blog art because I like the way the art cried out to me and I hoped the art would give me some direction and motivation to sort out my company.
            
            Zeitgeist teaching is simple, yet detailed, and I love the huge number of examples in this course. I had not realized how powerful examples are. The examples help teach what Zeitgeist calls X-ray creativity, and I’m starting to create my company.
            
            Many courses promise to give step-by-step guidance but still leave you wondering what to do next. Zeitgeist course is different.
            
            At the end of the course, I knew what to do.
            
            <b>Thank you, Zeitgeist. I’m super-grateful for this company.</b></p>
